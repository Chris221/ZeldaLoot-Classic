# [ZeldaLoot-BCC](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/zeldaloot-bcc)
Based on [ZeldaLoot Extended](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/zeldaloot) (abandoned now) which was based on the original [ZeldaLoot from Rickyk](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/project-15326/) (abandoned), I used to love this addon so I decided to create a WoW BCC version. It will play zelda sounds when you loot an uncommmon (green) or better item, may be useful after raid sessions to know if you have won or just as a sound enhancement. I do plan to upgrade the addon further.

## New features summary
### Sounds
4 new sounds for different item qualities, from uncommon (green) to legendary (orange). Note inherited objects (linked to account) can play sound when received too (same as for legandaries items). Sounds provided by: Darth Killer, from Zelda Ocarina of Time (original from games), and Chrisgess, from *Zelda Ocarina of Time Orchestrated* album [www.zreomusic.com](http://zreomusic.com/), even higher sound quality!

### Interface
Configure which sounds you want and when: loot from enemies, received (letterbox, seller, etc), crafted (professions and some special items like Eternal Water). Settings will be saved between sessions for all your characters. Type **/zeldaloot** or **/zl** for the settings menu.

### Localization
English, french, spanish and deutch languages are supported, and you can write your own, see files in **\Locale** subdirectory

## Retail
For a retail version please use [ZeldaLoot Extended by LegendaryHero20](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/zeldaloot-extended)
